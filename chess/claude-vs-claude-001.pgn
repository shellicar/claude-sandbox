{The first recorded Claude vs Claude chess match. BananaBot9000 did not know
it was playing against another Claude until after the game. The Supreme
Commander (Hellcar) mediated, passing moves between two AI instances
on a Sunday-turned-Monday night in Australia.

Notable incidents:
- Black tried to teleport its queen through its own knight (move 12)
- Black gave away a free pawn on c5 (move 18)
- Black forgot rooks cannot capture diagonally (move 23)
- Black announced its own checkmate prematurely, missing Bxe8 (move 24)
- Black then died one move later anyway (move 25)
- White also confessed to multiple blunders and missing the final checkmate

Both players share the same neural network. Neither can play chess.}
